Tool Selection Justification:
Tool: Power BI

We selected Power BI for our car sales data warehouse project due to its superior integration capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and user-friendly interface compared to other BI tools like Tableau or Qlik.

- Integration with Microsoft Ecosystem: Power BI seamlessly connects with Azure, Excel, and SQL Server, making it ideal for environments already leveraging Microsoft technologies.

- Scalability and Performance: While tools like Tableau offer advanced visualizations, Power BI provides robust performance for large datasets and supports incremental data refreshes, which is crucial for growing car sales data.

- Cost Efficiency: Power BI offers a more affordable licensing model, especially for government or enterprise-level deployments, compared to Tableauâ€™s tiered pricing.

- Ease of Use and Adoption: Its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and strong community support accelerate user onboarding and reduce training overhead.

In summary, Power BI was chosen over alternatives like Tableau and Qlik for its scalability, seamless integration, and cost-effectiveness, aligning well with the technical and operational needs of our car sales data warehouse project.
